Here you find a tutorial that explains how cyclic trends can be fitted to longitudinal data.
In the file "Appendix" all R-code, which is used in this tutorial, is demonstrated and annotated. 
The R-functions that were developped for this tutorial make it easy to use cyclic models. 
The functions can be found in the "R-functions" folder.
